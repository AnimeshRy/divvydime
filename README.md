# Hackathon Project Logs

1. This is going to be a payment splitting app. Me and my friends use Splitwise a lot when we go out on trips and mostly anywhere we have to share a bill. This app will be an alternative to Splitwise.
2. This app would be a PWA and offcourse my mobile friendly.
3. App should be able to handle splitting among users without making them log in inside the app.

4. Firstly I'll just pick a simple and clean UI for the landing page for the app and move forward with that.
